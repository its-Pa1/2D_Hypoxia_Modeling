## Methods Applied
For comprehensive information on methods, encompassing data processing, quantification of blood vessel diversity, mathematical modeling of oxygen and hypoxia, numerical simulation of PDE, parameter estimation, and validation, please consult the "Methods" section in this paper.


## Requirement
To execute the scripts, MATLAB with the Global Optimization Toolbox, Image Processing Toolbox, and Parallel Computing Toolbox is required.


## Other Files and Folders
ColorMaskFunctions: It includes the functions generated by MATLAB colorthresholder to extract respective marker based on colors.

T_forms: The transformation for each IHC images to register their CD31 and CA9 scans.

Plots: To save the plots.

1087_IFC_full_sample_Validation.mat: the densities for 1087 IFC full sample saved as MALTAB workspace. Since calculating cell-density requires time.

1905_IHC_full_sample_Validation.mat: the densities for 1905 IHC full sample saved as MALTAB workspace. Since calculating cell-density requires time.
